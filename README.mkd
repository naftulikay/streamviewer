#streamviewer#
Stream viewer is a very simple web application which allows you to directly 
view streams from media servers and HTTP endpoints. By supplying a server URI 
and a stream name, you can connect to that server and view that stream in JW 
Player. 

View RTMP streams by using a URL like `rtmp://localhost/live` and a stream name
like `mp4:testStream`. 

This app was designed primarily to make testing streams a bit easier for the 
overburdened developer.
